#### Hi, I'm Zhen.

I’m an MSCS student at Georgia Tech. I’m interested in visualization, human-computer interaction, learning programming languages and graphics.

**I'm on the lookout for an internship opportunity for Summer 2024!** 

My areas of interest are diverse, encompassing everything from web/mobile development, data visualization to broader software development engineering roles. If you're hiring or wish to collaborate, feel free to reach out!
